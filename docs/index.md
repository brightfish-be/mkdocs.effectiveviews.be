## Monkey See, Monkey Do.

How does the chameleon effect work?
Watching a movie in the cinema with other people results in enhanced attention. 
And watching with family members or loved ones increases attention even more. 
How do we explain this extraordinary effect? And how can you as an advertiser benefit from it?

We’d like to share with you the white paper 
"_Monkey See, Monkey Do. How watching entertainment together with people you love increases the impact of advertising_" 
by professor Jelle Demanet, researcher at Profacts and Ghent University associate. 
In this white paper, he takes an objective look at how the chameleon effect works and 
at how oxytocin affects your brain and your advertising communication.

## Want to know how much of your ad people actually see? 

!!! question inline end "OTS? Viewability? Buying eyeballs?"


Now you can _measure it_.
How much time do consumers actually spend looking at my ad? 
As an advertiser, you’ve no doubt often wondered. 
But how can you actually know how much viewing time your ads actually get? 
That has simply not been possible. Until now, that is.

Together with the research teams at Profacts and Lumen, 
Brightfish has come up with a way of measuring actual views accurately 
across a wide variety of media. 
By using a unique combination of data sets and eye-tracking, 
it’s now perfectly possible to see whether someone is **really looking** at a screen. 
And for **how long**. With crystal clear statistical data as a result.

Where does your commercial profit most?

| cinema                 | television           | web                   |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
 | ![img.png](img/cinema.png) | ![img_1.png](img/tv.png) | ![img_2.png](img/web.png) |
| **85%**                | **23.1%**            | **1.4%**              |
| effective views        | effective views      | effective views       |

### Cinema ads receive 85% attention

The results are literally eye-catching! 
In the case of online advertisements, a mere 1.4% of them are, on average, actually viewed. 
TV fairs a little better, ringing in at 23.1%. 
Cinema, however, leaps out with a **massive 85%**. 
All without distracting our gaze. 
And we have some more yielding statistics that cannot be overlooked.

### Get a lot more effective attention/€
Of course cinema-goers watch more attentively – we hear you thinking – 
in the dark, from their comfortable seats, etc. 
ut it costs me a lot more as an advertiser.

But that is far from the truth! 
When expressed in terms of actual attention per euro, 
cinema is actually a lot more cost-effective. 
Per 1000 contacts at the cinema, **1 second of actual attention costs €2.60**. 
On TV, the amount rises to €3.10 and online up to as much as €62.60!

We call it “attention CPM” or **aCPM**. 
The _cost of 1 second of actual attention per 1000 contacts_. 
Something we explain in detail in our white paper.
